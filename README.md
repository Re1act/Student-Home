- `templates/`: Contains HTML files for rendering the frontend pages. These templates manage the display of the GPA calculator, class schedule, assignments, and user login/registration pages.
- `static/`: Holds CSS and JavaScript files used to style the pages and enhance the client-side user experience.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of the Python dependencies required to run the app. It includes necessary libraries such as `Flask`, `Flask-SQLAlchemy`, and `Flask-Session`.
- `README.md`: This document that provides an overview of the project, its features, and instructions for setup and usage.

## Languages & Technologies Used:
- **Python**: The backend of the application is built using Python and the Flask web framework. It handles all the application logic, such as managing routes, processing user input, and interacting with the database.
- **SQLite**: The application uses SQLite as the database to store user data, assignments, class schedules, and other critical information. SQLAlchemy ORM is used for efficient database operations and management.
- **JavaScript**: Client-side scripting is used for interactive features like dynamic form validation, smooth transitions, and asynchronous updates to the UI.
- **HTML/CSS**: The frontend uses HTML for the structure and CSS for styling to create an intuitive and visually appealing user interface.
